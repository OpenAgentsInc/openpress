We have set up a fresh Laravel v11 repo with:
- Laravel Breeze (Blade/Alpine)
- Tailwind CSS
- SQLite
- Pest

We want to implement the following features via test-driven development using Pest.

Relevant models:
- User
- Post

Unit tests:
- User can be an editor
- User can have many Posts

Feature tests:
- Editor can create a post
  - Non-editors cannot make posts
- Individual Posts are visible publicly at `/posts/{id}`
- A list of all Posts is visible publicly at `/`
  - Editors can see the homepage (fixing the current redirect to dashboard)

Here's our Post info:
   INFO  Model [app/Models/Post.php] created successfully.
   INFO  Factory [database/factories/PostFactory.php] created successfully.
   INFO  Migration [database/migrations/2024_10_03_184403_create_posts_table.php] created successfully.
