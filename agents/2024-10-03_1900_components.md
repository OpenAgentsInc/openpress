We want to create Laravel Blade components based on shadcn UI components, written in React and Tailwind.

We are keeping the Tailwind classes as-is, while replacing React with Blade.

Components are defined in the GitHub repo shadcn-ui/ui, main branch. (Specify this branch when you use view_file tool.)

We need to adapt five components:

- apps/www/registry/new-york/ui/avatar.tsx
- apps/www/registry/new-york/ui/button.tsx
- apps/www/registry/new-york/ui/card.tsx
- apps/www/registry/new-york/ui/input.tsx
- apps/www/registry/new-york/ui/label.tsx

New versions must go in:
- resources/views/components/shad/button.blade.php
- (etc.)

And copy the CSS variables for 'zinc' from this file `apps/www/registry/registry-base-colors.ts` to our `tailwind.config.js`
