We're brainstorming hosting.

Similar to WordPress, a technical user should be able to download the OpenPress codebase from this repo and install it themselves on any supported server. But anyone else has the option of hosting one or more sites on their own infrastructure, likely using their own Laravel Forge account in conjunction with server infra they connect to that, or other options.

Updated Plan:
- We're not going to use server or database management APIs for now.
- Users can add a site and connect it to a GitHub repo.
- We expect there to be a Laravel site deployed in the connected repo.
- Users have two options:
  1. Self-managed: They can set up the site themselves and provide the repo URL.
  2. Managed by OpenPress.ai: We create and manage the repo in our GitHub org, and users get access to it.
- Users can interact with their repo using OpenAgents chat tools.

Relevant models:
- User
- Site

Relevant files:
- Model [app/Models/Site.php] created successfully.
- Factory [database/factories/SiteFactory.php] created successfully.
- Migration [database/migrations/2024_10_04_221148_create_sites_table.php] created successfully.

User tests:
- User can have many Sites
- Site has:
  - string `name`, required
  - string `root_domain`, nullable
  - string `github_repo_url`, nullable
  - boolean `is_managed_by_openpress`, default false
- Site belongs to a User

Feature tests:
- User can add a Site
- User can see a list of their Sites in their Dashboard (at /dashboard)
- User can connect a GitHub repo to their Site
- User can choose between self-managed and OpenPress-managed options when creating a Site
- User can interact with their Site's repo using OpenAgents chat tools

Additional considerations and questions:
1. GitHub Integration:
   - How will we handle GitHub authentication for repo access?
   - Do we need to implement GitHub webhooks for automatic updates?

2. OpenPress-managed Sites:
   - What will be the process for creating and managing repos in our GitHub org?
   - How will we grant users access to these repos?

3. OpenAgents Chat Integration:
   - How will we integrate the OpenAgents chat tools with the Site management interface?
   - What specific actions will users be able to perform via chat?

4. Deployment:
   - For self-managed sites, will we provide deployment instructions or integrations?
   - For OpenPress-managed sites, how will we handle the deployment process?

5. Site Templates:
   - Will we offer pre-configured Laravel site templates for users to choose from?

6. Custom Domain Management:
   - How will we handle custom domain setup and DNS management?

7. User Permissions:
   - Will we need to implement different levels of access for site collaborators?

8. Monitoring and Analytics:
   - What kind of site monitoring and analytics will we offer to users?

9. Scalability:
   - How will this approach scale as we add more users and sites?

10. Security:
    - What security measures do we need to implement to protect user sites and data?

These considerations will help guide our development process and ensure we create a robust and user-friendly platform for OpenPress site management.
