We're brainstorming hosting.

Similar to WordPress, a technical user should be able to download the OpenPress codebase from this repo and install it themselves on any supported server. But anyone else has the option of hosting one or more sites on their own infrastructure, likely using their own Laravel Forge account in conjunction with server infra they connect to that, or other options.

Relevant models:
- User
- Site

User tests:
- User can have many Sites
- Site has:
  - string `name`, required
  - string `root_domain`, nullable
- Site belongs to a User

Feature tests:
- User can add a Site
- User can see a list of their Sites in their Dashboard (at /dashboard)
