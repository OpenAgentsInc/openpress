# OpenPress.ai Forge Integration Log

## Current Status

We have successfully created a ForgeService class and a CreateForgeSite command that can create a new site on a Forge server. We have also created a GitHub template repository and a new command to attach a GitHub repo to a Forge site.

## GitHub Template Creation Process

1. **Create a fresh Laravel installation locally**:
   ```bash
   laravel new openpress-template
   cd openpress-template
   ```

2. **Install and configure Breeze with Blade**:
   ```bash
   composer require laravel/breeze --dev
   php artisan breeze:install blade
   ```

3. **Make any desired opinionated changes to the structure or configuration**

4. **Initialize git repository and make initial commit**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Fresh Laravel installation with Breeze and Blade"
   ```

5. **Create a new public repository on GitHub named "openpress-template"**

6. **Push the local repository to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/openagentsinc/openpress-template.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

7. **On GitHub, go to the repository settings and convert it to a template repository**

## GitHub Repo Setup

The GitHub template has been created and is now available at https://github.com/OpenAgentsInc/atlantisports as a private repository.

## New Command: AttachGitHubRepoToForgeSite

We have created a new command to attach a GitHub repository to a Forge site. The command is structured similarly to the CreateForgeSite command and is located at `app/Console/Commands/AttachGitHubRepoToForgeSite.php`.

Usage:
```bash
php artisan forge:attach-repo {siteId} {repoUrl}
```

## ForgeService Updates

The ForgeService has been updated to include a new method `attachGitHubRepo` which handles the API call to attach a GitHub repository to a Forge site. The service now also includes a `serverId` property, which is initialized from the configuration.

## Relevant Forge API Endpoints

1. **Install New Repository**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/servers/{serverId}/sites/{siteId}/git`
   - This will connect the GitHub repo to the Forge site

2. **Update Repository**:
   - Endpoint: `PUT /api/v1/servers/{serverId}/sites/{siteId}/git`
   - This can be used to update the repository details if needed

3. **Get Deployment Script**:
   - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/servers/{serverId}/sites/{siteId}/deployment/script`
   - Retrieve the current deployment script

4. **Update Deployment Script**:
   - Endpoint: `PUT /api/v1/servers/{serverId}/sites/{siteId}/deployment/script`
   - Customize the deployment script if necessary

5. **Enable Quick Deploy**:
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/servers/{serverId}/sites/{siteId}/deployment`
   - This will enable automatic deployments when changes are pushed to the repository

## Next Steps

1. Test the new AttachGitHubRepoToForgeSite command with the created template repository

2. Implement GitHub integration:
   - Implement OAuth for user authentication if needed for self-managed sites
   - Develop functionality to create repositories from the template (either in OpenPress.ai org or user's account)

3. Further extend ForgeService:
   - Add methods for updating deployment script and enabling quick deploy

4. Update the CreateForgeSite command:
   - Add options for self-managed vs OpenPress-managed sites
   - Integrate the GitHub repo creation and connection process

5. Develop user interface:
   - Create forms for users to input necessary information (site name, managed/self-managed preference, etc.)
   - Display site and repository information in the user dashboard

6. Implement error handling and logging:
   - Ensure robust error handling for both Forge and GitHub operations
   - Implement logging for debugging and monitoring purposes

7. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for the new GitHub integration functionality
   - Create integration tests for the entire site creation process

8. Documentation:
   - Update user documentation to explain the site creation process
   - Create developer documentation for the new classes and methods

9. Deployment process:
   - Set up the Forge deployment script to handle the Laravel application correctly
   - Ensure environment variables are properly set in Forge
   - Configure any necessary services (database, cache, etc.) in Forge

10. User onboarding:
    - Create a guide for users on how to clone and work with their new repository
    - Provide instructions on how to make changes and trigger deployments

By following these steps, we can create a seamless process for users to create sites with connected GitHub repositories based on our opinionated Laravel template, whether they choose the self-managed or OpenPress-managed option.
